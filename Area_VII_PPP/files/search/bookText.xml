                       Staff Development Program


               CVSU LIBRARY STAFF DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

                       Staff development is a purposive effort intended to strengthen the library’s capability
               to fulfill its mission effectively and efficiently by encouraging and providing for the growth of
               its human resources.

                       While training is understood as the process, by which an individual learns new ways
               of information or techniques and changes from a state of being incapable of doing the job
               or being ineffective.

                       Therefore, this issue encompasses all the means by which staffs are empowered to
               do their jobs effectively and to prepare themselves to meet the changing needs.

                      resources.

                       Section 1. Selection

                                            responsibility of the deans, department chairs, faculty members
                                            and the library staff.

                                            to  submit  requests  and  recommendations  in  the  specialized

                                            of the immediate demand of the curriculum, the selection shall
                                            be the responsibility of the librarian. However, the librarian may
                                            solicit recommendations coming from faculty and students.

                                            and  bibliographical  investigation  (dictionaries,  encyclopedias,

                                            shall be the joint responsibility of the librarian and the faculty
                                            members.

                                     e.     Selection of materials should be based on the following:

                                            Library  materials  shall  be  acquired  through  purchase,
                                     donations, gift or exchange items which the selection personnel have
                                     identified as a desirable addition to the collection. Level of collecting

                                            library’s discretion. Materials received will be evaluated prior to
                                            addition to the collection based on the same standards used in
                                            purchasing  new  materials.  The  library  reserves  the  right  to

                                            trading of publications with other libraries. Exchange agreement
                                            is an attempt made to have an equitable balance in the value of
                                            the materials sent and received.

                                     Library classification schemes serve to arrange books and other library
                              materials  in  a  logical  order  on  library  shelves  and  also  provide  order  for
                              classified catalogs.

                                     The LDML uses the Library of Congress Classification System or LCC
                              (Table 3) for books and Dewey Decimal Classification or DDC (Table 4) for
                              manuscripts.  The  LCC  system  groups  the  subject  using  the  letters  of  the
                              alphabet  and  Arabic  numerals,  while  the  DDC  groups  the  subjects  using
                              Arabic numerals only.

                                     Combination  of  the  following  ways  of  classification  is  also  used:  1)
                              classification by subject content; and 2) classification by physical form.

                              retrieval. This refers to the process of cataloguing and classification including
                              the preparation of all library materials. Cataloging and classification are used

                              to develop an index of the library collection to enable users to determine if the
                              library has the resources they need.

                       Section 1. Descriptive Cataloging

                                            Descriptive  Cataloging  is  the  part  of  the  library  cataloging
                                     process  concerned  with  identifying  and  describing  the  physical  and
                                     bibliographic  characteristics  of  the  item,  and  with  determining  the
                                     name(s) and title(s) to be used as access points in the catalog, but not
                                     with the assignment of subject and form headings.
                                            Descriptive cataloging consists of two elements: a) describing
                                     the physical item of the material and; b) determining the main entry and
                                     correct formatting of the entry and added entries suited for the material.

                                            Anglo American Cataloging Rules edition 2 (AACR2) divides the
                                     catalog record into eight areas as shown in Table 5. For books, the
                                     chief source of information is the title page and the verso of the title
                                     page.

                                                   choice of main entry. The general principle of main entry
                                                   is  to  enter  a  work  under  the  name/s  of  person(s)  or

                                                   the case of books, the chief source of information is the
                                                   title page.

                                            b.     The information is recorded exactly as it appears on the
                                                   title page. Information appearing elsewhere in the item

                                                   author  entry  used  in  the  catalog  (in  current  practice,
                                                   editors  and  compilers  are  never  given  a  main  entry,
                                                   although they were given one in the part) is ensured.

                                            c.     In current practice, authors are always entered under the
                                                   commonly  known  name  (e.g.,  Mark  Twain  is  under
                                                   Twain, Mark rather than Clemens, Samuel Langhorne).
                                                   The general rule for titles of nobility is to employ the most
                                                   commonly  used  name.  An  aristocrat  may  be  entered
                                                   under his or her family name or title (e.g., the Duke of
                                                   Wellington is entered under his title rather than his family
                                                   name) (Figure 5).

                                                   corporate body. It is rare for a school library to have a
                                                   large  number  of  government  documents  or  works
                                                   emanating from corporate groups. If there is doubt on the
                                                   part  of  the  cataloguer,  the  main  entry  is  done  by  title
                                                   (Figure 6).

                                            Subject cataloging is the process of assigning subject headings
                                     and classification number to a reference material. It deals with what is
                                     inside the book or library material with the purpose of listing under one
                                     uniform word or phrase all the materials on a given topic that a library
                                     has. Subject cataloging determines the subject or topic of the book. It
                                     usually  assigns  one  or  more  subject  headings  from  a  specified
                                     thesaurus, such as the Library of Congress Subject Headings or Sears’
                                     List of Subject Headings and the assignment of classification number
                                     from the classification schedule such as LC or DDC. Subject cataloging
                                     is done to:

                                            a.     Provide access by subject to all relevant materials

                                            b.     Provide subject access to materials through all suitable
                                                   principles of subject orientation.

                                                   ▪       Application etc.

                                            c.     Bring  together  references  to  materials  which  deal  with
                                                   the same subject regardless of disparities in terminology
                                                   ▪       Due to national differences
                                                   ▪       Due  to  differences  among  groups  of  subject

                                                           within the discipline itself.

                                                   possible,  whether  the  description  is  in  the  form  of  a
                                                   classification number or symbol

                                            h.     Provide  a  means  for  the  user  to  make  selection  from
                                                   among all items in a particular category according to any
                                                   chosen set of criteria (most thorough, most recent, most
                                                   basic, etc.)


                                            Subject cataloging involves subject analysis which determines
                                     the focus of the intellectual content of a work, translating it into concept
                                     of the framework of the classification and heading system used and
                                     then  finally  translating  the  concept  into  a  classification  number  and
                                     subject headings.

                                            Subject heading is an access point to a bibliographic record. It
                                     consists if a word or phrase which designates the subject of the work
                                     or  works  contained  in  the  bibliographic  record.  Subject  headings
                                     identify pertinent material on a given subject or topic enabling users to
                                     find materials on related subjects. Sears list of subject headings is the
                                     tool commonly used by cataloguers in assigning subject headings.

                                            The call number is composed of the classification number and
                                     book number for a particular library material, i.e. the title of the book

                                     2015, the classification number of this title is, LB1025.3 (based on the
                                     Library of Congress Classification Scheme), its book number is K14 to

                                            Book number represents the letter of the author’s surname or
                                     the first letter of the title of the book (if it begins with an article, the first
                                     three letters of the word after the article) and the corresponding figure
                                     of the letter as found in the Cutter Two Figure Author Table, the tool
                                     being used at LDML.
                                            The purpose of the Cutter Author Table is to provide the shortest
                                     possible  combination  of  letters  and  figures  to  be  used  for  the  book
                                     number. There are many vowels and consonants, except S; two letters
                                     are used for vowels and S; three letters are used for names beginning
                                     with Sch combinations.

                                                           The  following  examples  shown  in  Figure  11
                                                   indicate how four books, all on the second World War by
                                                   four  different  authors  (Arnold,  Dana,  Sherman  and
                                                   Scanlon)  would  be  marked  with  940.54  as  the
                                                   classification number; and Ar6, D16, Sh5 and Sca6 as
                                                   the respective Cutter numbers.

                                                                             number

                                            b.     In  case  no  number  fits  a  name  exactly,  the  preceding
                                                   number is used. For example: Blains would be under B57
                                                   (Blaf) which is the preceding number (Sample 7).

                                            c.     When two authors share the same number, it is advisable
                                                   to add a digit. A good number to select is 5, as there is
                                                   then room for both sides for additional interpolation as
                                                   necessary. For example: A book already in the collection
                                                   by Richard Taylor would be T21. A new book added to
                                                   the same classification number by another author named
                                                   Taylor would need a different author number. A book by
                                                   Sidney Taylor could then be T215. This leaves room for
                                                   the insertion of additional authors between Richard and
                                                   Sydney – using T212, T213 and T214. (It is best to avoid
                                                   using 1 and 9, if possible, since the use of either would
                                                   mean going to a fourth figure when another author has
                                                   to  be  inserted).  To  accommodate  a  book  by  Harriet
                                                   Taylor,  it  would  be  necessary  to  go  to  the  previous
                                                   number – which is T19. In this case, it is wise to add a
                                                   digit such as T195, since an author beginning with Tau
                                                   would cause a conflict.
                                            d.     For shelving purposes, Cutter number within any given
                                                   class should be considered as a decimal arrangement.
                                                   For example: T19, T195, T21, T212, etc. (Not T12, T21,
                                                   T195, T212).

                                            e.     A  work  mark  is  used  to  distinguish  titles  by  the  same
                                                   author. This is a letter taken from the first key word in the
                                                   title. Thus: A writer’s Notebook by Maugham would be
                                                   designated  M44w;  and  Of  Human  Bondage  would  be
                                                   M44o. In the case of voluminous authors, the use of two
                                                   letters  for  the  work  mark  is  advisable.  Thus:  Dickens’
                                                   David  Copperfield  would  be  D55da  and  Dombey  and

                                                   Son D55do. (Note: A lower case letter or letters is used
                                                   for  the  work  mark,  rather  than  a  capital  letter.  It  is
                                                   imperative that a script l be used so that there will be no
                                                   confusion with number 1). In case of books in series, by
                                                   the  same  author,  all  in  the  same  classification  and
                                                   beginning with the same word – such as Zaidenberg’s
                                                   How to Draw ... --  it is advisable to use the key words for
                                                   the work mark.

                                                   For example: How to Draw Cartoons would be Z1hc; and
                                                           How to Draw People would be Z1hp. (This method
                                                           avoids excessively long work marks, such as h,
                                                           ho, how, how).

                                            f.     The use of zero is avoided because it is easily confused
                                                   with the letter O. That is why there are no zeros used in
                                                   the table.

                                            g.     Names beginning with Mc, M, and Mac are all treated as
                                                   though they were spelled Mac. Thus McElroy would be
                                                   M15 and MacFarland would be M16.

                                                   fiction. Books by authors with similar surnames are more
                                                   easily located on the shelf if there is a number on the
                                                   spine.

                                                   For example: Johnson would be J63 and Johnstone J65.

                                            i.     Very often a main entry is under title (e.g. periodicals,
                                                   anonymous works, government publications, almanacs,
                                                   encyclopedias, etc.). In this case the Cutter number is
                                                   taken from the first word in the title (exclusive of articles).
                                                   An example would be St7 for The Story of the Wise Men;
                                                   World Almanac would be W89. (There is, of course, no
                                                   work mark).

                                                   from  the  name  of  the  biographies,  not  the  author.  All
                                                   biographies  of  Lincoln  would  be  under  L63.  The  work
                                                   mark in this case is not taken from the title, but is the first
                                                   letter  of  the  author’s  surname.  Thus  Charnwood’s  the
                                                   use of a second letter is sometimes necessary (Figure
                                                   12).

                                                         Currant’s biography of Lincoln would be L63cu.

                       Section 2. Factors of Deterioration

                                            Deterioration  is  a  change  of  original  state  of  any  material  by
                                     interaction  between  the  object  and  the  factors  of  destruction.  The
                                     different  types  of  deterioration  of  the  paper  based  materials  are
                                     reflected in wear and tear, shrinkage, cracks, brittleness, warping, bio-
                                     infestation,  discoloration,  abrasion,  hole,  dust  and  dirt  accumulation
                                     etc.  Library  materials  are  susceptible  to  deterioration  by  the  some
                                     factors,  namely,  Environmental  factors,  Biological  factors,  Chemical
                                     factors, Human factors and Disasters.

                                     a.     Environmental Factors

                                            ▪      Light
                                                           Whether natural light or artificial light paper gets
                                                   deteriorated  when  it  is  exposed  to  light.  Especially
                                                   sunlight,  has  a  serious  damaging  effect  on  written  or
                                                   printed paper materials. The ultraviolet radiation of light
                                                   are mainly responsible for photochemical degradation of
                                                   paper which takes place rapidly when paper is exposed
                                                   to  sun  light  in  presence  of  air  (oxygen).  When  some
                                                   portion of cellulose is oxidized to oxycellulose, the long
                                                   cellulose  chains  are  broken  and  the  paper  becomes
                                                   weak and brittle. Fading of ink and dye of the coloured
                                                   paper and yellowing of white paper also takes place due
                                                   to  the  formation  of  oxycellulose.  Artificial  light  like
                                                   fluorescent tube light also radiates a high percentage of
                                                   ultraviolet  rays  which  cause  deterioration  by  yellowing

                                                   the  paper.  However,  the  amount  of  damage  by  light
                                                   depends upon the following factors.
                                                           1)     Intensity  of  light-  as  the  intensity  of  light
                                                                  increases  the  rate  of  deterioration  of  the
                                                                  paper also increases.
                                                           2)     Duration  of  exposure-  the  duration  of
                                                                  exposure  of  paper  to  light  is  directly
                                                                  proportional to its deterioration.
                                                           3)     Distance from the source of light- more the
                                                                  distance, less the damage.

                                            ▪      Heat
                                                           Usually  the  source  of  heat  is  high  atmospheric
                                                   temperature.  Heat  is  measured  in  terms  temperature
                                                   either in Centigrade scale or Fahrenheit scale. High heat
                                                   with low humidity causes dehydration of cellulose fibers
                                                   and the paper becomes brittle. It loses its flexibility to the
                                                   extent  that  it  tends  to  crumble  on  touch.  On  the  other
                                                   hand,  high  temperature  with  high  humidity  creates  the
                                                   condition for the growth of moulds. If electric bulbs are
                                                   used  for  lighting  purpose,  they  increase  room
                                                   temperature as high powerful bulbs generate more heat.
                                                   Besides,  extreme  variation  in  temperature  (say  50c  in
                                                   winter  and  450c  in  summer)  affects  the  physical
                                                   condition of the library materials.

                                            ▪      Humidity and Moisture
                                                           Humidity  is  the  amount  of  moisture  in  the
                                                   atmospheric air. The moisture is measured in terms of
                                                   relative humidity. All organic objects absorb water to a
                                                   greater  or  lower  extent  and  the  water  goes  inside  the
                                                   object  through  surrounding  air.  Because  of  this
                                                   absorbency property, the paper absorbs more moisture
                                                   when there is high humidity. Certain amount of humidity
                                                   is necessary for the flexibility of paper but in prolonged
                                                   high  humid  condition,  paper  becomes  soggy  and  the
                                                   moisture weakens the fibers of paper. Moisture is the root
                                                   cause  of  various  types  of  physical,  chemical  and
                                                   biological  deterioration  of  library  materials.  It  weakens
                                                   the adhesive and makes the book binding loose. It also
                                                   weakens  the  sizing  elements  of  paper  and  causes
                                                   spreading  of  ink.  Moisten  pages  of  book  often  stuck
                                                   together.  It  also  accelerates  various  types  of  chemical
                                                   deterioration as a result of which paper becomes yellow
                                                   and  stained  with  spots.  Moisture  also  promotes  the
                                                   growth  of  fungus,  which  cause  damage  to  paper  and
                                                   book binding materials.

                                            ▪      Dust and Dirt
                                                           Fine dry particles of any matter present in the air
                                                   are known as dust. Dust, which is highly dangerous for
                                                   the library and archival collection, composed of soil, tar,
                                                   metallic substances, fungus spores and moisture among
                                                   other things. Since dust is air borne it settles down on
                                                   any surface of the object. Dust is hygroscopic in nature
                                                   and when it is mixed with high humidity, it is transformed
                                                   into dirt and if this dirt sticks to the surface of the books,
                                                   it becomes difficult to remove. Dust and dirt are sources
                                                   of both physical and chemical degradation of the library
                                                   collection. Dust acts as a nucleus around which moisture
                                                   collects  and  this  moisture  provides  the  necessary
                                                   humidity  for  the  growth  of  fungus  and  for  chemical
                                                   reaction, which lead to the formation of acids. Since dust
                                                   and dirt are solid particles of varying size and hardness
                                                   they exert abrasion on the surface of the books.


                                            ▪      Water
                                                           Water  occurs  in  all  the  normal  state  of  matter-
                                                   solid,  liquid  and  gas.  It  acts  as  a  physical  agent  of
                                                   deterioration  by  causing  hygroscopic  materials  to
                                                   undergo dimensional changes. Water, which is harmful
                                                   for  the  library  collection  may  come  from  sources  like
                                                   natural  calamities,  human  negligence,  from  leaking
                                                   roofs, defective plumbing and through open windows at
                                                   the  time  of  raining.  Excessive  water  brings  about
                                                   biological attack on paper, which is usually manifested
                                                   as the growth of fungus or mildew. The effects of water
                                                   are stained paper, rotted leather, smeared ink, weaken
                                                   adhesive, sustained fungi etc. Water also does injury to
                                                   the steel furniture due to rusting.

                                                   The  deterioration  caused  by  biological  agents  such  as
                                            micro-organisms,  insects  and  rodents  is  generally  known  as
                                            bio-deterioration.  Almost  all  book  components,  be  it  paper,
                                            leather, textiles or straw  board used  for binding  are  prone to
                                            attacks  by  these  biological  agents.  The  problem  of  bio-
                                            deterioration is a matter of considerable significance of tropical
                                            hot  and  humid  climate  like  India.  The  climatic  condition
                                            accelerates the growth and multiplication of living organisms.
                                            There is perhaps no library, which has not suffered the ravages
                                            of  these  agents  of  bio-deterioration.  These  biological  agents
                                            can  be  subdivided  into  micro-organisms  (fungus  or  molds,
                                            bacteria etc.), insects, rodents, micro- organisms

                                            ▪      Fungus
                                                           Fungus is a large heterogeneous group of plant
                                                   organisms. The fungal spores are present in the earth,
                                                   water  and  air  and  remain  in  a  doormat  state  for  long
                                                   periods. These spores sprout and grow when they have
                                                   the required moisture and heat. Generally fungi grow in
                                                   a relative humidity range of 63-100% and temperature
                                                   range of 15-350c. In libraries fungal growth is known as
                                                   mold  or  mildew  and  they  appear  as  brown/black
                                                   vegetative growth on paper, leather and textiles. Fungus
                                                   consume cellulose and also thrive on nutrients in leather,
                                                   glues,  pastes,  binding  threads  etc.  they  weaken  and
                                                   stain the paper and can cause discoloration.

                                            ▪      Bacteria
                                                           Besides  fungus,  bacteria  also  decompose
                                                   cellulose in paper and binding textiles.

                                            ▪      Insects
                                                           Even though there are thousands of insects, only
                                                   certain  insects  badly  damage  the  archive-library
                                                   materials.  They  are  silverfish,  cockroaches,  booklice,
                                                   bookworms and termites.

                                            ▪      Silverfish
                                                           The  main  sources  of  these  insects  are  food
                                                   materials like starch, glue and gelatin which are used in
                                                   paper as sizing materials. Dust and dirt also attract these
                                                   insects.  They’re  fond  of  dark  places  and  are  active  in
                                                   nights only. Silverfish do not have wings and are silvery
                                                   or pearl gray in color and about 8 to 10 mm. in length.
                                                   They eat the surface of the paper and also eat gum from
                                                   postage  stamps,  envelopes  etc.  They  grow  holes  in
                                                   paper,  prints,  photographs,  catalogue  cards  and
                                                   cardboard boxes. The dark spaces on the library racks,
                                                   catalogue cabinets, and drawers are the places for their
                                                   egg laying.

                                            ▪      Cockroaches
                                                           Cockroaches  are  common  all  over  the  world
                                                   which  are  brown  or  blackish  brown  in  color.  They  eat
                                                   paper  leaves,  bookbinding,  fabrics  and  other  organic
                                                   materials. They are frequently found in libraries, archives
                                                   and museums and are very active during the night. They
                                                   live in corners which are damp, cleavages in walls and
                                                   floors,  behind  and  beneath  shelves  and  in  wooden

                                                   cupboards.  They  excrete  a  dark  brown  liquid,  which
                                                   leave stains on the paper and become difficult to remove.

                                            ▪      Book Worms or Book Beetles
                                                           Bookworms  affect  very  much  books  and
                                                   manuscripts. As the name itself suggests they feed on
                                                   paper and damage the paper extensively. In libraries the
                                                   bookworms lay their eggs on the edges of the books and
                                                   on the surface of the bookbinding. They make tunnels in
                                                   the pages and boards of the books.


                                            ▪      Book Lice
                                                           Dark  dusty  areas  filled  with  unused  books,
                                                   dampness and warmth are essential requirements for the
                                                   growth of booklice. They are gray or white in colour. They
                                                   injure the bindings of books by eating paste and glue and
                                                   also eat the fungus formed in between the edges of inner
                                                   cover of the books.

                                            ▪      Termites or White Ants
                                                           In the tropical climate the damages to the library
                                                   materials  due  to  termites  are  much.  Wet  or  damp
                                                   conditions are most suitable places for termites. They eat
                                                   wood  and  paper  and  can  attack  any  type  of  material
                                                   containing  cellulose.  If  once  they  start  destroying  the
                                                   books they can do irreparable damage in no time. They
                                                   leave mud encrustation on the attacked materials. They
                                                   are  of  two  categories  like  earth  dwelling  termites  and
                                                   wood dwelling termites. Earth dwelling termites live in the
                                                   soil and in the libraries their presence can be noticed by
                                                   their mud tunnels on the walls, book cases and furniture.
                                                   Wood dwelling termites live above the ground and enter
                                                   the building through cracks and openings.

                                            ▪      Rodents
                                                           Rodents  include  mice,  rats,  squirrels  and  many
                                                   other species. Mice and rats are mainly found in libraries
                                                   and they find their way into buildings through dry drains
                                                   and openings in doors and windows. In libraries they eat
                                                   and destroy materials made up of paper, cloth, leather,
                                                   glue, etc. These animals are very swift to move and hide
                                                   in dark corners.

                                     c.     Chemical Factors

                                                   In the manufacturing of paper sometimes fibers are used
                                            with low cellulose contents and some chemical compounds like

                                            alum, rosin etc. are used for sizing of paper which cause acidic
                                            effect and facilitate chemical deterioration of the paper with the
                                            passage  of  time.  Besides,  in  the  atmosphere  among  various
                                            constituents  unwanted  materials  such  as  oxides  of  carbon,
                                            sulphur,  nitrogen  and  hydrogen  sulphides  are  also  present.
                                            Because  of  the  absorption  of  the  chemicals  by  the  moisture
                                            absorbed by the paper, the library materials get affected. The
                                            notable  deleterious  substances  for  the  library  materials  are
                                            sulphur dioxides, oxides of nitrogen and ozone. Sulphur dioxide
                                            is a hazard to cellulose materials like paper and cloth. The most
                                            familiar effect in libraries is the brown and brittle edges of books
                                            caused by sulphur dioxide. Most of the nitrogen dioxide comes
                                            from automobile exhausts & when it combines with oxygen and
                                            water  turns  into  nitric  acid.  This  nitric  acid  has  strong  acidic
                                            effects  and  attacks  the  dyes  in  ink,  cloth,  paper  and  leather.
                                            Ozone  acts  as  a  powerful  destroyer  of  organic  materials.  It
                                            makes  the  colors  of  fabric  book  covers  fade  and  the  book
                                            binding materials such as leather, gelatin, glue and paste are
                                            also susceptible to deterioration by ozone in humid atmosphere.

                                     d.     Human Factors

                                                   Apart  from  physical  and  chemical  factors,  a  serious
                                            cause of deterioration often is the casual attitude of the library
                                            staff  as  well  as  the  users  of  the  library  towards  books  as
                                            physical  objects.  Librarians  in  charge  of  the  documentary
                                            heritage  are  directly  responsible  for  the  overall  conservation
                                            and preservation of their collections. But they are not always
                                            aware  how  to  handle,  store  and  use  collections  carefully  to
                                            minimize damage and help preservation. The standard of care
                                            and handling of books by their custodians and users is often
                                            pretty low. Improper storage, faulty repairment, rough handling,
                                            deliberate abuse, folding the fore-edges of pages as a mark of
                                            reading,  marking  by  ballpen,  mutilation,  vandalism  are  all
                                            examples of deterioration of books by human beings.

                                     e.     Disasters

                                                   No library is exempted to the devastations that can occur
                                            as  a  result  of  natural  or  manmade  disasters.  In  libraries,
                                            archives  and  museums  there  is  a  likely-hood  of  fire  as  the
                                            collections are mostly organic in nature. Once fire starts, it is
                                            difficult to save those materials which get fire. Items not directly
                                            engulfed  in  flames  can  be  charred  by  soot  and  smoke.  Heat
                                            emitted from fire causes bindings to shrink and warp and plastic
                                            base materials to melt. Water used for fighting fire can cause
                                            enormous damage. Besides fire, floods, high winds, cyclones,
                                            earth  quakes  are  also  agents  of  deterioration  for  the  library

                                            collections. These will lead documents to absorb water, swell,
                                            warp  and  become  extremely  vulnerable  to  physical  damage.
                                            Dyes and ink may bleed and book pages stick together. Leather
                                            bindings seriously warp and change shape. Effects of disasters
                                            on library collections are too obvious to comprehend.

                       Section 3. Care and Handling of Library Materials

                                            Careful handling of library materials by all library staff is being
                                     practiced to help preserve the collections and to encourage users to
                                     do the same.

                                     a.     Library collections should be kept in a cool, clean and low light
                                            area to ensure they last as long as possible.

                                     b.     Both  temperature  and  humidity  are  monitored  in  collection
                                            areas and checked regularly by the staff.

                                     c.     Blinds are kept closed in storage areas, away from sunlight.

                                     d.     Food and Drinks are never kept close to library materials; they
                                            can stain paper and increase the risk of pest infestation. Even
                                            vases,  potted  plants  and  cups  of  coffee  are  kept  away  from
                                            library materials.

                                     e.     Library items are never left on the floor because they will be
                                            damaged by even the smallest leak.

                                     f.     Pests are completely eliminated in the library.

                                     g.     Hands  should  be  always  kept  clean  and  dry  while  touching
                                            paper. Both skin oil and perspiration stain paper. Cotton gloves
                                            can be used, but might be too clumsy to handle fragile materials.

                                     h.     Wet fingers should not be used to turn papers.

                                     i.     Plenty of clean work space is always provided. Library items are
                                            kept on the table and not held in hands. Rare or tightly bound
                                            books are laid open on a book support available in the reading
                                            room.

                                     j.     Never lean on books or documents for a writing surface. Use
                                            pencil when you are working with library materials.

                                     k.     If essential notes, such as call numbers, need to be made in a
                                            book, use a soft lead pencil.

                                     l.     If pages of books and other items must be marked, use acid-
                                            free  paper  strips.  Do  not  fold  the  corners  of  pages  or  use
                                            printed, colored adhesive paper, such as “post-it” self-adhesive
                                            notes.

                                     m.     13.  Photocopying  is  one  of  the  major  causes  of  damage  to
                                            library books. Some materials are difficult to handle and copy
                                            safely.  Most  importantly,  do  not  press  down  on  the  spine  of
                                            books while photocopying and take extra care with large and
                                            heavy books. There are some types of materials which are so
                                            fragile they should not be photocopied at all.

                                     n.     If you have to move items than cannot be held comfortably in
                                            hand, use a trolley. Never overload a trolley, make two trips.

                                     o.     Unnecessary  metal  clips,  paper  fasteners,  pins  and  staples
                                            should be removed; rust stains and holes will eventually result
                                            if these are left in place. Remove carefully and, if necessary,
                                            replace with smooth, solid plastic paper clips, white cotton tape
                                            ties or an acid- free folder or pocket. Rubber bands should be
                                            removed and discarded because they curl and tear the edges
                                            of paper and will eventually age and break.

                                     p.     Try  not  to  overstuff  or  under-fill  storage  boxes  –  overstuffing
                                            cramps  and  creases  items,  under  filling  allows  sagging  and
                                            bending. Use fillers made of acid free materials.

                                     q.     Generally books should be supported upright on the shelf by
                                            other  books  or  bookends.  Books  left  leaning  on  shelves  can
                                            cause the book to become distorted and the binding may break.
                                            Large books such as elephant folios and broadsheets should be
                                            stored flat on the shelf otherwise the weight of the pages can
                                            damage the binding, but do not stack them too high or they will
                                            be difficult to remove.

                                     r.     Do not overcrowd the shelves. Books should slide easily onto
                                            shelves  without  force.  Make  space  if  they  do  not.  Shelves
                                            should be deep enough to fully support the volume and leave a
                                            space between the books and the back of the shelf to allow air
                                            circulation.

                                     s.     Make sure materials in compact units are not protruding or likely
                                            to fall on the ground, because it will be crushed.

                                     t.     A book should be removed from the shelf by grasping firmly the
                                            center of the spine. Never remove books from the shelves by
                                            pulling at the top of the spine, this is the most vulnerable part of
                                            the spine, and can tear or break easily.

                                     u.     Pamphlets can easily be lost or damaged on shelves because
                                            they are so small. If placed straight on the shelf or in a half-filled
                                            upright  pamphlet  box,  they  can  become  slouched,  squashed
                                            and crushed. Individual pamphlets can be stored in see-through
                                            polypropylene  folders  and  groups  of  pamphlets  and  serial
                                            issues in grey polypropylene serial boxes.

                                     v.     Single sheet materials are best stored flat in folder or boxes, but
                                            may be stored upright in a polypropylene pamphlet folder or with
                                            adequate support in a folder in an archive box if the archive box
                                            has been filled to prevent its contents sagging.

                                     w.     If any items are handled frequently, they should be placed in
                                            Mylar pocket or copied, to protect the original item.

                                     x.     Large  sheet  material  should  be  stored  flat  in  shallow  plan
                                            cabinet drawers. Drawers should not be overfilled because this
                                            will make retrieval difficult and sheets can easily be damaged
                                            as the drawers are opened and closed. Do not fold any item; it
                                            will eventually break along the fold. If material is too large to fit
                                            in drawers, it can be placed in a folder in an adequately sized
                                            storage space or on storage rolls made for it.

                                     y.     Folded or rolled items should be opened with care and gently,
                                            but firmly, held open with paper weights; very stiff and tightly
                                            rolled items may need to be relaxed before unrolling.

                                     z.     Large plans, maps, or any large  paper sheets are  preferably
                                            handled  in  Mylar  pockets  and  are  usually  easily  carried  by
                                            diagonally opposite corners.

                       Section 4. Disaster Preparedness

                                            Disasters  are  generally  unexpected  events  with  destructive
                                     consequences to a collection. Therefore it is vital for any library to take
                                     every possible precaution to prevent the occurrence of an unavoidable
                                     disaster.  A  disaster  planning  is  an  essential  element  of  preventive
                                     conservation. It is also necessary to identify any external and internal
                                     threats that might cause problems for the collection and measures to
                                     meet those threats. Without an existing disaster preparedness plan or
                                     crisis management plan, the librarians will be unable to act quickly to
                                     organize salvage efforts. It should be mandatory for every library to
                                     have a  written disaster preparedness and response plan containing
                                     description  of  emergency  procedures,  emergency  supplies  list,
                                     disaster response outline, conservation experts, list of staff volunteers,
                                     list  of  external  contacts  and  names,  addresses,  home  and  work
                                     telephone  numbers  of  personnel  with  emergency  responsibilities.

                                     Besides,  libraries should  be  provided with fire  and smoke detection
                                     system and automatic fire extinguishing system. Use of match stick or
                                     open  flame  and  smoking  should  strictly  prohibit  inside  the  library.
                                     Inflammable materials and chemicals should not be stored inside the
                                     stacks. The telephone number of the fire office should be visibly and
                                     clearly  exhibited.  Location  of  emergency  gate  must  be  clearly

                                            Preservation and conservation of library materials are concern
                                     of all library staff and all users of the CvSU.

                                            The  University  Librarian  is  responsible  for  determining
                                     conservation priorities for all archival records, as well as the nature and
                                     extent of conservation and preservation treatments to be carried out.
                       Section 6. Selection of Library Materials for Preservation

                                            Materials are selected for preservation according to the
                                     following priorities:

                                            a.     significance/value/rarity of the material;
                                            b.     amount and kind of usage; and
                                            c.     physical condition of the material.

               Article 5. Weeding of Library Materials

                                     Weeding is the process wherein books and other library materials that
                              are no longer needed are taken out of the collection. This is done to keep the
                              collection updated and responsive to the needs and interest of the users. This
                              may result in discarding of materials. (Example: return to the supply office,
                              donating to other libraries, etc.)

                                     Evaluation  of  library  collection  is  done  in  order  to  determine  if  the
                              materials the library has are still suitable to the needs of its users. Selection
                              and acquisition of library materials plays an important role in the collection
                              development as weeding of non-circulating items in the collection. Weeding
                              is necessary to make space for current materials, to make the collection more
                              attractive, to facilitate ease of use of the collections by patrons and staff, and
                              to reduce damage to books caused by overcrowding and space limitations.

                       Section 1.  Weeding Criteria

                                            Library materials are weeded when:

                                            a.     the  materials  have  not  been  used  for  more  than  ten
                                                   years;

                                            b.     the condition of the item is bad, e.g. missing pages, worn-
                                                   out, and text is unreadable;
                                            c.     the  Science  and  Technology  materials  that  are
                                                   copyrighted/published more than three to five years;
                                            d.     the materials are no longer in demand or do not support
                                                   the curriculum or current academic programs;
                                            e.     older edition of the book is no longer used; and
                                            f.     books become obsolete.


                       Section 2. Weeding Criteria for Specific Subject Fields

                                            a.     Philosophy (B-BD, BH, BJ)

                                                           Most philosophy books do not become outdated,
                                                   although circulation is often low, titles should be retained
                                                   unless  superseded  by  more  recent  editions.  However,
                                                   duplicate copies of low-usage books are weeded so as
                                                   historical and explanatory texts when superseded. Books
                                                   on systems of philosophy should be retained.

                                            b.     Psychology (BF)

                                                           A 5-year weeding process shall be implemented
                                                   to  maintain  a  usable  and  up-to-date  collection.
                                                   Biographies  or  primary  works  of  psychologists  and
                                                   encyclopedia  shall  be  judged  by  their  emphasis  on
                                                   primary works.
                                            c.     Religion (BL-BX)

                                                           Materials on this subject do not generally become
                                                   outdated but titles that have very low usage, superseded
                                                   editions,  unused  duplicates,  older  sectarian  literature,
                                                   sermons  and  books  on  the  conduct  of  life  should  be
                                                   considered for weeding.

                                            d.     History (C, D, E, F)

                                                           History  collection  shall  be  periodically  reviewed
                                                   for their continuing usefulness. Older books that reflect
                                                   the  expressions  of  another  era,  regardless  of  the
                                                   accuracy of predictions made in them about the future
                                                   and earlier editions of classic or standard text regardless
                                                   of  current  curriculum  needs,  are  retained.  Books  with
                                                   bibliography,  appendices,  maps,  illustrations  or  other
                                                   supplementary features that are still useful should also
                                                   be retained.

                                                   according  to  circulation  figures,  but  unless  they  have
                                                   historical approach, they are of little use after five years.

               Article 6. Collection Analysis and Evaluation

                       Section 1. Introduction

                                            Collection Analysis is the systematic evaluation of the quality of
                                     a library collection to determine the extent to which it meets the library’s
                                     service goals and objectives and the information needs of its clientele.

                                            The purpose of collection analysis and evaluation is to
                                     determine the quality of the collection. It falls into two parts: first, one
                                     must evaluate the collection itself in terms of numbers, quality,
                                     currency, and the like. Second, the collection should be judged on
                                     how well it serves the needs of the community.

                       Section 2. Methods Used for Evaluating Library Collection

                                            a.     Compiling statistics on holdings, use, expenditures

                                            b.     Checking lists, catalogs, bibliographies

                                            c.     Obtaining opinions from regular users

                                            d.     Examining the collection directly

                                            e.     Applying standards

               Article 7. Updating

                                     The Collection Development and Management Policies are reviewed
                              and updated regularly.

                                     local  journals/magazines  and  newspapers  acquired  to  by  the

                                            mind, a periodical index can help him/her find articles about that
                                            topic. An index will point to the right periodical, the specific date
                                            or  issue  copy,  and  even  the  pages  for  a  specific  article.  A
                                            periodical  index  works  like  a  subject  catalog  for  the  articles
                                            within a group of magazines and journals. The process of using
                                            an index is similar to the process of doing subject or keyword
                                            searches for items in a library catalog. The University Library
                                            has  both  print  indexes  in  book  form  and  computer-based
                                            indexes available on Excel;
                                     f.     Selected articles of periodicals are organized and stored in a
                                            vertical file;
                                     g.     Maintenance of record serials subscribed and received;
                                     h.     Consolidating of statistics of users and materials usage (daily,
                                            weekly, monthly);
                                     i.     Maintenance of stacks area (shelving and shelfreading); and

                              librarian/s and library staff. Every material added to the library collection is
                              processed in the Technical Services Section before it is brought to the proper

                                            Selection is the process of deciding which materials should be
                                     added to a library collection. Selection of new materials is a continuous
                                     process  requiring  evaluation  of  both  the  current  collection  and  the

                                     books and serials from brochures/catalog given by dealers are sent to
                                     the  deans  of  the  different  colleges  for  recommendation.  List  of
                                     recommended books is forwarded to the dealers so that the books will
                                     be  delivered  for  examination.  List  of  recommended  serial  titles  is

                       Section 2. Acquisition

                                            Acquisition is the process of selecting, ordering, and receiving
                                     materials for library collections by purchase, exchange, or gift, which
                                     may include budgeting and negotiating with outside agencies, such as
                                     publishers,  dealers,  and  vendors,  to  obtain  resources  to  meet  the
                                     needs  of  the  institution’s  clientele,  in  the  most  economical  and
                                     expeditious manner.

                                            Acquisition through purchase, donation, gift or exchange of the
                                     items  that  the  selection  personnel  have  identified  as  a  desirable
                                     addition  to  the  collection  is  systematically  implemented.  The
                                     acquisition process starts by providing respective colleges the list of
                                     books  and  serials  (journals,  magazines,  etc.)  for  purchase/
                                     subscription.  Recommendation  slips  are  then  collected  and
                                     summarized for purchase. The following forms are then accomplished:

                                     a.     Purchase Request (PR) form;
                                     b.     Obligation Request (OR) form;

                                     f.     Inspection and Acceptance Record (IAR) form; and
                                     g.     Acknowledgment Receipt of Equipment (ARE) form.

                       Section 3. Material Processing

                                            Material processing of the newly acquired books is unpacked
                                     and  inspected  for  imperfections.  Defective  items  are  returned  for
                                     replacement.  Finally,  acceptable  books  are  stamped  with  mark
                                     ownership on the designated part/portion of the book.

                                            A  set  of  policies  on  library  collection  development  is  being
                                     implemented in the University to assist the library in the selection and
                                     acquisition of relevant resources.

                       Section 4. Accessioning

                                     retrieval in case a problem arises.

                                            Example:

                                                   You  received  10  books  on  November  15,  2015.  After
                                            these have been catalogued (descriptive cataloging), arrange
                                            them alphabetically according to their access point.

                       Section 5. Cataloging

                                            Cataloging is the process of making a bibliographic record about
                                     published  works,  particularly  books.  Bibliographic  records  are
                                     designed  to  facilitate  easy  retrieval  and  to  support  administrative
                                     activities  such  as  acquisitions,  circulation,  preservation  and
                                     management of collection (Figure 4). Cataloging is divided into two
                                     parts namely:

                                     a.     Descriptive Cataloging. It is a part of the cataloging process
                                            wherein the cataloger transfers certain technical data about an
                                            item  into  a  record  according  to  rules.  Simply  stated,  it  is
                                            describing an item bibliographically based on standard rules as
                                            stated in AACR2 or the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules 2.

                                     b.     Subject  Cataloging.  It  is  a  part  of  the  cataloging  process
                                            wherein the cataloger assigns appropriate subject headings for
                                            the item selected from the standard list subject headings, e.g.
                                            Sear’s  List  of  Headings  and  the  Library  of  Congress  Subject
                                            Headings. Catalog entries are then checked against authority
                                            file for possible duplication.

                       Section 6. Classification

                                            Classification  is  the  process  of  dividing  library  materials  into
                                     logically hierarchical classes, subclasses, and sub-subclasses based
                                     on the characteristics they have in common and those that distinguish
                                     them. Classification by arranging library materials according to subject
                                     content, physical form, date and place of publication, is conducted to
                                     locate books and other library materials in a logical  order on library
                                     shelves. Encoding  of catalog entries  into the database is done; bar
                                     codes are printed on newly processed book and subject bibliographies
                                     are prepared (Figure 4).
