                                     c.     Newspaper  Clippings.  Clippings  are  maintained  to
                                            provide     researchers       easy     access     in    locating
                                            information from newspaper sources;
                                     d.     Indexing.  A  periodical  index  is  a  type  of  reference
                                            source  that  lists  periodical  articles  by  subject  or
                                            author. If one has a topic in mind, a periodical index
                                            can  help  him/her  find  articles  about  that  topic.  An
                                            index will point to the right periodical, the specific date
                                            or issue copy, and even the pages for a specific article.
                                            A periodical index works like a subject catalog for the
                                            articles within a group of magazines and journals. The
                                            process of using an index is similar to the process of
                                            doing  subject  or  keyword  searches  for  items  in  a
                                            library  catalog.  The  University  Library  has  both  print
                                            indexes  in  book  form  and  computer-based  indexes
                                            available on Excel;
                                     e.     Selected  articles  of  periodicals  are  organized  and
                                            stored in a vertical file;

                              added  to  the  library  collection  is  processed  in  the  Technical
                              Services  Section  before  it  is  brought  to  the  proper  section  for
                              circulation.

                       Section 1. Selection

                                            Selection  is  the  process  of  deciding  which  materials
                                     should  be  added  to  a  library  collection.  Selection  of  new
                                     materials  is  a  continuous  process  requiring  evaluation  of
                                     both  the  current  collection  and  the  materials  being
                                     considered  for  acquisition.  Lists  of  available  titles  of  books
                                     and serials from brochures/catalog given by dealers are sent
                                     to  the  deans  of  the  different  colleges  for  recommendation.
                                     List  of  recommended  books  is  forwarded  to  the  dealers  so
                                     that  the  books  will  be  delivered  for  examination.  List  of
                                     recommended  serial  titles  is  subscribed  as  budget  permits.
                                     Requesting  parties  are  notified  of  the  delivery  of  requested
                                     materials  in  the  Technical  Services  Section  of  the  library.
                                     Notice on the allotted period for the examination of the items
                                     to be considered for acquisition is also given.

                       Section 2. Acquisition

                                            Acquisition  is  the  process  of  selecting,  ordering,  and
                                     receiving  materials  for  library  collections  by  purchase,
                                     exchange,  or  gift,  which  may  include  budgeting  and
                                     negotiating  with  outside  agencies,  such  as  publishers,
                                     dealers, and vendors, to obtain resources to meet the needs
                                     of  the  institution’s  clientele,  in  the  most  economical  and
                                     expeditious manner.

                                            Acquisition  through  purchase,  donation,  gift  or
                                     exchange  of  the  items  that  the  selection  personnel  have
                                     identified  as  a  desirable  addition  to  the  collection  is
                                     systematically  implemented.  The  acquisition  process  starts
                                     by providing respective colleges the list of books and serials
                                     (journals,  magazines,  etc.)  for  purchase/  subscription.
                                     Recommendation  slips  are  then  collected  and  summarized
                                     for purchase. The following forms are then accomplished:

                                     a.     Purchase Request (PR) form;
                                     b.     Obligation Request (OR) form;

                                     f.     Inspection and Acceptance Record (IAR) form; and
                                     g.     Acknowledgment Receipt of Equipment (ARE) form.

                       Section 3. Material Processing

                                            Material  processing  of  the  newly  acquired  books  is
                                     unpacked  and  inspected  for  imperfections.  Defective  items
                                     are  returned  for  replacement.  Finally,  acceptable  books  are
                                     stamped      with     mark     ownership      on    the    designated
                                     part/portion of the book.

                                            A  set  of  policies  on  library  collection  development  is
                                     being implemented in the University to assist the library in
                                     the selection and acquisition of relevant resources.

                       Section 4. Accessioning

                                            Accessioning is the process of assigning a number to a
                                     particular  book  and  recording  the  item  in  the  accession
                                     record  book.  Sample  of  accession  record  book  is  shown
                                     below. Column legend for Table 1 is indicated as well.

                                     date is a must for easy retrieval in case a problem arises.

                                            Example:

                                                   You  received  10  books  on  November  15,  2015.
                                            After  these  have  been            catalogued  (descriptive
                                            cataloging),  arrange  them  alphabetically  according  to
                                            their access point.

                       Section 5. Cataloging

                                            Cataloging  is  the  process  of  making  a  bibliographic
                                     record     about     published      works,     particularly     books.
                                     Bibliographic records are designed to facilitate easy retrieval
                                     and to support administrative activities such as acquisitions,
                                     circulation,  preservation  and  management  of  collection
                                     (Figure 4). Cataloging is divided into two parts namely:

                                     a.     Descriptive Cataloging. It is a part of the cataloging
                                            process  wherein  the  cataloger  transfers  certain
                                            technical data about an item into a record according to



                                                          Page 27]]></page><page Index="28"><![CDATA[CvSU Library Manual of Operations




                                            rules.  Simply  stated,  it  is  describing  an  item
                                            bibliographically based on standard rules as stated in
                                            AACR2 or the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules 2.

                                     b.     Subject  Cataloging.  It  is  a  part  of  the  cataloging
                                            process  wherein  the  cataloger  assigns  appropriate
                                            subject  headings  for  the  item  selected  from  the
                                            standard  list  subject  headings,  e.g.  Sear’s  List  of
                                            Headings  and  the  Library  of  Congress  Subject
                                            Headings.  Catalog  entries  are  then  checked  against
                                            authority file for possible duplication.

                       Section 6. Classification

                                            Classification  is  the  process  of  dividing  library
                                     materials into logically hierarchical classes, subclasses, and
                                     sub-subclasses  based  on  the  characteristics  they  have  in
                                     common and  those that distinguish them.  Classification by
                                     arranging  library  materials  according  to  subject  content,
                                     physical form, date and place of publication, is conducted to
                                     locate books and other library materials in a logical order on
                                     library shelves. Encoding of catalog entries into the database
                                     is done; bar codes are printed on newly processed book and
                                     subject bibliographies are prepared (Figure 4).

               Article 7. Library Classification Scheme

                                     Library  classification  schemes  serve  to  arrange  books  and
                              other library materials in a logical order on library shelves and also
                              provide order for classified catalogs.

                                     The  LDML  uses  the  Library  of  Congress  Classification
                              System  or  LCC  (Table  3)  for  books  and  Dewey  Decimal
                              Classification or DDC (Table 4) for manuscripts. The LCC system
                              groups  the  subject  using  the  letters  of  the  alphabet  and  Arabic
                              numerals,  while  the  DDC  groups  the  subjects  using  Arabic
                              numerals only.

                                            Combination  of  the  following  ways  of  classification  is
                              also used: 1) classification by subject content; and 2) classification
                              by physical form.

               Article 8. Collection Organization

                                     The  library  ensures  that  the  collection  is  organized  for
                              efficient  retrieval.  This  refers  to  the  process  of  cataloguing  and
                              classification  including  the  preparation  of  all  library  materials.
                              Cataloging  and  classification  are  used  to  develop  an  index of  the
                              library collection to enable users to determine if the library has the
                              resources they need.

                       Section 1. Descriptive Cataloging

                                            Descriptive  Cataloging  is  the  part  of  the  library

                                     the  physical  and  bibliographic  characteristics  of  the  item,
                                     and with determining the name(s) and title(s) to be used as
                                     access points in the catalog, but not with the assignment of
                                     subject and form headings.

                                            Descriptive  cataloging  consists  of  two  elements:  a)
                                     describing  the  physical  item  of  the  material  and;  b)
                                     determining  the  main  entry  and  correct  formatting  of  the
                                     entry and added entries suited for the material.

                                     divides the catalog record into eight areas as shown in Table
                                     5. For books, the chief source of information is the title page
                                     and the verso of the title page.

                                     Choice and Form of Main Entry

                                            a.     The first task facing the cataloger is to determine
                                                   the choice of main entry. The general principle of
                                                   main entry is to enter a work under the name/s
                                                   of person(s) or corporate body responsible for its
                                                   intellectual  content.  In  the  case  of  books,  the
                                                   chief source of information is the title page.

                                            b.     The information is recorded exactly as it appears
                                                   on  the  title  page.  Information  appearing
                                                   elsewhere  in  the  item  within  the  catalog  entry.
                                                   The consistent spelling of the author entry used
                                                   in  the  catalog  (in  current  practice,  editors  and
                                                   compilers are never given a main entry, although
                                                   they were given one in the part) is ensured.


                                            c.     In current practice, authors are always entered
                                                   under  the  commonly  known  name  (e.g.,  Mark
                                                   Twain  is  under  Twain,  Mark  rather  than
                                                   Clemens,  Samuel  Langhorne).  The  general  rule
                                                   for  titles  of  nobility  is  to  employ  the  most
                                                   commonly  used  name.  An  aristocrat  may  be
                                                   entered  under  his  or  her  family  name  or  title
                                                   (e.g., the Duke of Wellington is entered under his
                                                   title rather than his family name) (Figure 5).

                                            Subject cataloging is the process of assigning subject
                                     headings and classification number to a reference material.
                                     It deals with what is inside the book or library material with
                                     the purpose of listing under one uniform word or phrase all
                                     the  materials  on  a  given  topic  that  a  library  has.  Subject
                                     cataloging  determines  the  subject  or  topic  of  the  book.  It
                                     usually  assigns  one  or  more  subject  headings  from  a
                                     specified thesaurus, such as the Library of Congress Subject
                                     Headings  or  Sears’  List  of  Subject  Headings  and  the
                                     assignment  of  classification  number  from  the  classification
                                     schedule such as LC or DDC. Subject cataloging is done to:

                                                   deal  with  the  same  subject  regardless  of

                                                   World  War  by  four  different  authors  (Arnold,
                                                   Dana, Sherman and Scanlon) would be marked

                                            b.     In  case  no  number  fits  a  name  exactly,  the
                                                   preceding number is used. For example: Blains
                                                   would  be  under  B57  (Blaf)  which  is  the
                                                   preceding number (Sample 7).

                                                   advisable to add a digit. A good number to select
                                                   is  5,  as  there  is  then  room  for  both  sides  for
                                                   additional  interpolation  as  necessary.  For
                                                   example:  A  book  already  in  the  collection  by
                                                   Richard Taylor would be T21. A new book added
                                                   to  the  same  classification  number  by  another
                                                   author  named  Taylor  would  need  a  different
                                                   author number. A book by Sidney  Taylor could
                                                   then be T215. This leaves room for the insertion
                                                   of  additional  authors  between  Richard  and
                                                   Sydney – using T212, T213 and T214. (It is best
                                                   to avoid using 1 and 9, if possible, since the use
                                                   of  either  would  mean  going  to  a  fourth  figure
                                                   when  another  author  has  to  be  inserted).  To
                                                   accommodate a book by Harriet Taylor, it would
                                                   be  necessary  to  go  to  the  previous  number  –
                                                   which  is  T19.  In  this  case,  it  is  wise  to  add  a
                                                   digit  such  as  T195,  since  an  author  beginning
                                                   with Tau would cause a conflict.

                                            d.     For  shelving  purposes,  Cutter  number  within
                                                   any  given  class  should  be  considered  as  a
                                                   decimal  arrangement.  For  example:  T19,  T195,
                                                   T21, T212, etc. (Not T12, T21, T195, T212).

                                            e.     A work mark is used to distinguish titles by the
                                                   same author. This is a letter taken from the first
                                                   key word in the title. Thus: A  writer’s Notebook
                                                   by Maugham would be designated M44w; and Of
                                                   Human Bondage would be M44o. In the case of
                                                   voluminous  authors,  the  use  of  two  letters  for
                                                   the  work  mark  is  advisable.  Thus:  Dickens’
                                                   David Copperfield would be D55da and Dombey
                                                   and  Son  D55do.  (Note:  A  lower  case  letter  or
                                                   letters is used for the work mark, rather than a
                                                   capital  letter.  It  is  imperative  that  a  script  l  be
                                                   used  so  that  there  will  be  no  confusion  with
                                                   number  1).  In  case  of  books  in  series,  by  the
                                                   same  author,  all  in the  same  classification  and
                                                   beginning  with  the  same  word  –  such  as
                                                   Zaidenberg’s How to Draw ... --  it is advisable to
                                                   use the key words for the work mark.

                                                   For  example:  How  to  Draw  Cartoons  would  be
                                                           Z1hc;  and  How  to  Draw  People  would  be
                                                           Z1hp.  (This  method  avoids  excessively
                                                           long  work  marks,  such  as  h,  ho,  how,
                                                           how).

                                            f.     The  use  of  zero  is  avoided  because  it  is  easily
                                                   confused with the letter O. That is why there are
                                                   no zeros used in the table.

                                            g.     Names  beginning  with  Mc,  M,  and  Mac  are  all
                                                   treated  as  though  they  were  spelled  Mac.  Thus
                                                   McElroy  would  be  M15  and  MacFarland  would
                                                   be M16.

                                            h.     The  Cutter  Author  Table  is  particularly  well
                                                   suited to fiction. Books by authors with similar
                                                   surnames are more easily located on the shelf if
                                                   there is a number on the spine.

                                                   Cutter  number  is  taken  from  the  name  of  the
                                                   biographies,  not  the  author.  All  biographies  of
                                                   Lincoln would be under L63. The work mark in

                       Section 2. Factors of Deterioration

                                            Deterioration  is  a  change  of  original  state  of  any
                                     material by interaction between the object and the factors of
                                     destruction. The different types of deterioration of the paper
                                     based  materials  are  reflected  in  wear  and  tear,  shrinkage,
                                     cracks,  brittleness,  warping,  bio-infestation,  discoloration,
                                     abrasion,  hole,  dust  and  dirt  accumulation  etc.  Library
                                     materials  are  susceptible  to  deterioration  by  the  some
                                     factors,  namely,  Environmental  factors,  Biological  factors,
                                     Chemical factors, Human factors and Disasters.

                                     a.     Environmental Factors

                                                  Light
                                                           Whether  natural  light  or  artificial  light
                                                   paper  gets  deteriorated  when  it  is  exposed  to
                                                   light.  Especially  sunlight,  has  a  serious
                                                   damaging  effect  on  written  or  printed  paper
                                                   materials.  The  ultraviolet  radiation  of  light  are
                                                   mainly        responsible       for      photochemical
                                                   degradation  of  paper  which  takes  place  rapidly
                                                   when paper is exposed to sun light in presence
                                                   of air (oxygen). When some portion of cellulose is
                                                   oxidized  to  oxycellulose,  the  long  cellulose
                                                   chains are broken and the paper becomes weak
                                                   and brittle. Fading of ink and dye of the coloured
                                                   paper  and  yellowing  of  white  paper  also  takes
                                                   place  due  to  the  formation  of  oxycellulose.
                                                   Artificial  light  like  fluorescent  tube  light  also
                                                   radiates  a  high  percentage  of  ultraviolet  rays
                                                   which  cause  deterioration  by  yellowing  the
                                                   paper. However, the amount of damage by light
                                                   depends upon the following factors.
                                                           1)     Intensity of light- as the intensity of
                                                                  light    increases      the     rate     of
                                                                  deterioration  of  the  paper  also
                                                                  increases.
                                                           2)     Duration  of  exposure-  the  duration
                                                                  of  exposure  of  paper  to  light  is
                                                                  directly     proportional        to     its

                                                  Heat
                                                           Usually  the  source  of  heat  is  high
                                                   atmospheric  temperature.  Heat  is  measured  in
                                                   terms temperature either in Centigrade scale or
                                                   Fahrenheit  scale.  High  heat  with  low  humidity
                                                   causes  dehydration  of  cellulose  fibers  and  the
                                                   paper  becomes  brittle.  It  loses  its  flexibility  to
                                                   the extent that it tends to crumble on touch. On
                                                   the  other  hand,  high  temperature  with  high
                                                   humidity creates the condition for the growth of
                                                   moulds.  If  electric  bulbs  are  used  for  lighting
                                                   purpose,  they  increase  room  temperature  as
                                                   high  powerful  bulbs  generate  more  heat.
                                                   Besides,  extreme  variation  in  temperature  (say
                                                   50c  in  winter  and  450c  in  summer)  affects  the
                                                   physical condition of the library materials.

                                                  Humidity and Moisture
                                                           Humidity is the amount of moisture in the
                                                   atmospheric  air.  The  moisture  is  measured  in
                                                   terms  of  relative  humidity.  All  organic  objects
                                                   absorb water to a greater or lower extent and the
                                                   water      goes     inside    the     object     through
                                                   surrounding  air.  Because  of  this  absorbency
                                                   property, the paper absorbs more moisture when
                                                   there  is  high  humidity.  Certain  amount  of
                                                   humidity is necessary for the flexibility of paper
                                                   but  in  prolonged  high  humid  condition,  paper
                                                   becomes  soggy  and  the  moisture  weakens  the
                                                   fibers  of  paper.  Moisture  is  the  root  cause  of
                                                   various  types  of  physical,  chemical  and
                                                   biological  deterioration  of  library  materials.  It
                                                   weakens  the  adhesive  and  makes  the  book
                                                   binding  loose.  It  also  weakens  the  sizing
                                                   elements of paper and causes spreading of ink.
                                                   Moisten  pages  of  book  often  stuck  together.  It
                                                   also  accelerates  various  types  of  chemical
                                                   deterioration as a result of which paper becomes
                                                   yellow  and  stained  with  spots.  Moisture  also
                                                   promotes  the  growth  of  fungus,  which  cause
                                                   damage to paper and book binding materials.

                                                  Dust and Dirt
                                                           Fine dry particles of any matter present in
                                                   the air are known as dust. Dust, which is highly

                                                   dangerous for the library and archival collection,
                                                   composed  of  soil,  tar,  metallic  substances,
                                                   fungus spores and moisture among other things.
                                                   Since  dust  is  air  borne  it  settles  down  on  any
                                                   surface  of  the  object.  Dust  is  hygroscopic  in
                                                   nature and when it is mixed with high humidity,
                                                   it is transformed into dirt and if this dirt sticks
                                                   to the surface of the books, it becomes difficult
                                                   to  remove.  Dust  and  dirt  are  sources  of  both
                                                   physical and chemical degradation of the library
                                                   collection. Dust acts as a nucleus around which
                                                   moisture collects and this moisture provides the
                                                   necessary humidity for the growth of fungus and
                                                   for  chemical  reaction,  which  lead  to  the
                                                   formation of acids. Since dust and dirt are solid
                                                   particles of varying size and hardness they exert
                                                   abrasion on the surface of the books.

                                                  Water
                                                           Water  occurs  in  all  the  normal  state  of
                                                   matter-  solid,  liquid  and  gas.  It  acts  as  a
                                                   physical  agent  of  deterioration  by  causing
                                                   hygroscopic  materials  to  undergo  dimensional
                                                   changes. Water, which is harmful for the library
                                                   collection  may  come  from  sources  like  natural
                                                   calamities,  human  negligence,  from  leaking
                                                   roofs,  defective  plumbing  and  through  open
                                                   windows at the time of raining. Excessive water
                                                   brings about biological attack on paper, which is
                                                   usually  manifested  as  the  growth  of  fungus  or
                                                   mildew.  The  effects  of  water  are  stained  paper,
                                                   rotted  leather,  smeared  ink,  weaken  adhesive,
                                                   sustained  fungi  etc.  Water  also  does  injury  to
                                                   the steel furniture due to rusting.

                                     b.     Biological Factors

                                                   The  deterioration  caused  by  biological  agents
                                            such  as  micro-organisms,  insects  and  rodents  is
                                            generally known as  bio-deterioration. Almost all book
                                            components,  be  it  paper,  leather,  textiles  or  straw
                                            board used for binding are prone to attacks by these
                                            biological agents. The problem of bio-deterioration is a
                                            matter of considerable significance of tropical hot and
                                            humid  climate  like  India.  The  climatic  condition

                                            accelerates  the  growth  and  multiplication  of  living
                                            organisms. There is perhaps no library, which has not
                                            suffered  the  ravages  of  these  agents  of  bio-
                                            deterioration.     These     biological     agents     can    be
                                            subdivided  into  micro-organisms  (fungus  or  molds,
                                            bacteria etc.), insects, rodents, micro- organisms

                                                  Fungus
                                                           Fungus is a large heterogeneous group of
                                                   plant organisms. The fungal spores are present
                                                   in  the  earth,  water  and  air  and  remain  in  a
                                                   dormat  state  for  long  periods.  These  spores
                                                   sprout  and  grow  when  they  have  the  required
                                                   moisture  and  heat.  Generally  fungi  grow  in  a
                                                   relative  humidity  range  of  63-100%  and
                                                   temperature range of 15-350c. In libraries fungal
                                                   growth  is  known  as  mold  or  mildew  and  they
                                                   appear  as  brown/black  vegetative  growth  on
                                                   paper,  leather  and  textiles.  Fungus  consume
                                                   cellulose and also thrive on nutrients in leather,
                                                   glues, pastes, binding threads etc. they weaken
                                                   and stain the paper and can cause discoloration.

                                                  Bacteria
                                                           Besides  fungus,  bacteria  also  decompose
                                                   cellulose in paper and binding textiles.

                                                  Insects
                                                           Even  though  there  are  thousands  of
                                                   insects,  only  certain  insects  badly  damage  the
                                                   archive-library  materials.  They  are  silverfish,
                                                   cockroaches, booklice, bookworms and termites.

                                                  Silverfish
                                                           The main sources of these insects are food
                                                   materials like starch, glue and gelatin which are
                                                   used in paper as sizing materials. Dust and dirt
                                                   also  attract  these  insects.  They’re  fond  of  dark

                                                   are the places for their egg laying.

                                                  Cockroaches
                                                           Cockroaches  are  common  all  over  the
                                                   world  which  are  brown  or  blackish  brown  in
                                                   color.  They  eat  paper  leaves,  bookbinding,
                                                   fabrics  and  other  organic  materials.  They  are
                                                   frequently  found  in  libraries,  archives  and
                                                   museums and are very active during the night.
                                                   They live in corners which are damp,  cleavages
                                                   in walls and floors, behind and beneath shelves
                                                   and  in  wooden  cupboards.  They  excrete  a  dark
                                                   brown  liquid,  which  leave  stains  on  the  paper
                                                   and become difficult to remove.

                                                  Book Worms or Book Beetles
                                                           Bookworms  affect  very  much  books  and
                                                   manuscripts.  As  the  name  itself  suggests  they
                                                   feed on paper and damage the paper extensively.
                                                   In libraries the bookworms lay their eggs on the
                                                   edges  of  the  books  and  on  the  surface  of  the
                                                   bookbinding.  They  make  tunnels  in  the  pages
                                                   and boards of the books.

                                                  Book Lice
                                                           Dark  dusty  areas  filled  with  unused
                                                   books,  dampness  and  warmth  are  essential
                                                   requirements  for  the  growth  of  booklice.  They
                                                   are  gray  or  white  in  colour.  They  injure  the
                                                   bindings of books by eating paste and glue and
                                                   also eat the fungus formed in between the edges
                                                   of inner cover of the books.

                                                  Termites or White Ants
                                                           In the tropical climate the damages to the
                                                   library materials due to termites are much. Wet
                                                   or damp conditions are most suitable places for
                                                   termites.  They  eat  wood  and  paper  and  can
                                                   attack any type of material containing cellulose.
                                                   If once they start destroying the books they can
                                                   do  irreparable  damage  in  no  time.  They  leave
                                                   mud  encrustation  on  the  attacked  materials.
                                                   They  are  of  two  categories  like  earth  dwelling
                                                   termites  and  wood  dwelling  termites.  Earth

                                                   dwelling  termites  live  in  the  soil  and  in  the
                                                   libraries  their  presence  can  be  noticed  by  their
                                                   mud  tunnels  on  the  walls,  book  cases  and
                                                   furniture. Wood dwelling termites live above the
                                                   ground  and  enter  the  building  through  cracks
                                                   and openings.

                                                  Rodents
                                                           Rodents  include  mice,  rats,  squirrels  and
                                                   many  other  species.  Mice  and  rats  are  mainly
                                                   found  in  libraries  and  they  find  their  way  into
                                                   buildings  through  dry  drains  and  openings  in
                                                   doors  and  windows.  In  libraries  they  eat  and
                                                   destroy  materials  made  up  of  paper,  cloth,
                                                   leather, glue, etc. These animals are very swift to
                                                   move and hide in dark corners.

                                     c.     Chemical Factors

                                                   In the manufacturing of paper sometimes fibers
                                            are  used  with  low  cellulose  contents  and  some
                                            chemical compounds like alum, rosin etc. are used for
                                            sizing of paper which cause acidic effect and facilitate
                                            chemical deterioration of the paper with the passage of
                                            time.  Besides,  in  the  atmosphere  among  various
                                            constituents  unwanted  materials  such  as  oxides  of
                                            carbon, sulphur, nitrogen and hydrogen sulphides are
                                            also  present.  Because  of  the  absorption  of  the
                                            chemicals by the moisture absorbed by the paper, the
                                            library  materials  get  affected.  The  notable  deleterious
                                            substances  for  the  library  materials  are  sulphur
                                            dioxides,  oxides  of  nitrogen  and  ozone.  Sulphur
                                            dioxide  is  a  hazard  to  cellulose  materials  like  paper
                                            and  cloth.  The  most  familiar  effect  in  libraries  is  the
                                            brown  and  brittle  edges  of  books  caused  by  sulphur
                                            dioxide.  Most  of  the  nitrogen  dioxide  comes  from
                                            automobile exhausts & when it combines with oxygen
                                            and  water  turns  into  nitric  acid.  This  nitric  acid  has
                                            strong acidic effects and attacks the dyes in ink, cloth,
                                            paper and leather. Ozone acts as a powerful destroyer
                                            of organic materials. It makes the colors of fabric book
                                            covers  fade  and  the  book  binding  materials  such  as
                                            leather, gelatin, glue and paste are also susceptible to
                                            deterioration by ozone in humid atmosphere.

                                     d.     Human Factors

                                                   Apart  from  physical  and  chemical  factors,  a
                                            serious  cause  of  deterioration  often  is  the  casual
                                            attitude of the library staff as well as the users of the
                                            library  towards  books  as  physical  objects.  Librarians
                                            in  charge  of  the  documentary  heritage  are  directly
                                            responsible      for    the    overall    conservation       and
                                            preservation  of  their  collections.  But  they  are  not
                                            always aware how to handle, store and use collections
                                            carefully  to  minimize  damage  and  help  preservation.
                                            The  standard  of  care  and  handling  of  books  by  their
                                            custodians  and  users  is  often  pretty  low.  Improper
                                            storage, faulty repairment, rough handling, deliberate
                                            abuse,  folding  the  fore-edges  of  pages  as  a  mark  of
                                            reading,  marking  by  ballpen,  mutilation,  vandalism
                                            are  all  examples  of  deterioration  of  books  by  human
                                            beings.

                                     e.     Disasters

                                                   No  library  is  exempted  to  the  devastations  that
                                            can occur as a result of natural or manmade disasters.
                                            In  libraries,  archives  and  museums  there  is  a  likely-
                                            hood  of  fire  as  the  collections  are  mostly  organic  in
                                            nature.  Once  fire  starts,  it  is  difficult  to  save  those
                                            materials which get fire. Items not directly engulfed in
                                            flames  can  be  charred  by  soot  and  smoke.  Heat
                                            emitted from fire causes bindings to shrink and warp
                                            and  plastic  base  materials  to  melt.  Water  used  for
                                            fighting fire can cause enormous damage. Besides fire,
                                            floods,  high  winds,  cyclones,  earth  quakes  are  also
                                            agents of deterioration for the library collections. These
                                            will lead documents to absorb water, swell, warp and
                                            become extremely vulnerable to physical damage. Dyes
                                            and  ink  may  bleed  and  book  pages  stick  together.
                                            Leather  bindings  seriously  warp  and  change  shape.
                                            Effects  of  disasters  on  library  collections  are  too
                                            obvious to comprehend.

                       Section 3. Care and Handling of Library Materials

                                            Careful handling of library materials by all library staff
                                     is  being  practiced  to  help  preserve  the  collections  and  to
                                     encourage users to do the same.

                                     a.     Library collections should be kept in a cool, clean and
                                            low light area to ensure they last as long as possible.

                                     b.     Both  temperature  and  humidity  are  monitored  in
                                            collection areas and checked regularly by the staff.

                                     c.     Blinds  are  kept  closed  in  storage  areas,  away  from
                                            sunlight.

                                     d.     Food  and  Drinks  are  never  kept  close  to  library
                                            materials; they can stain paper and increase the risk
                                            of pest infestation. Even vases, potted plants and cups
                                            of coffee are kept away from library materials.

                                     e.     Library items are never left on the floor because they
                                            will be damaged by even the smallest leak.

                                     f.     Pests are completely eliminated in the library.

                                     g.     Hands  should  be  always  kept  clean  and  dry  while
                                            touching  paper.  Both  skin  oil  and  perspiration  stain
                                            paper.  Cotton  gloves  can  be  used,  but  might  be  too
                                            clumsy to handle fragile materials.

                                     h.     Wet fingers should not be used to turn papers.

                                     i.     Plenty of clean work space is always provided. Library
                                            items  are  kept  on  the  table  and  not  held  in  hands.
                                            Rare  or  tightly  bound  books  are  laid  open  on  a  book
                                            support available in the reading room.

                                     j.     Never  lean  on  books  or  documents  for  a  writing
                                            surface. Use pencil when you are working with library
                                            materials.

                                     k.     If  essential  notes,  such  as  call  numbers,  need  to  be
                                            made in a book, use a soft lead pencil.

                                     l.     If pages of books and other items must be marked, use
                                            acid-free paper strips. Do not fold the corners of pages
                                            or use printed, colored adhesive paper, such as “post-
                                            it” self adhesive notes.

                                     m.     13. Photocopying is one of the major causes of damage
                                            to library books. Some materials are difficult to handle
                                            and copy safely. Most importantly, do not press down
                                            on  the  spine  of  books  while  photocopying  and  take
                                            extra care with large and heavy books. There are some
                                            types of materials which are so fragile they should not
                                            be photocopied at all.

                                     n.     If  you  have  to  move  items  than  cannot  be  held
                                            comfortably  in  hand,  use  a  trolley.  Never  overload  a
                                            trolley, make two trips.

                                     o.     Unnecessary  metal  clips,  paper  fasteners,  pins  and
                                            staples should be removed; rust stains and holes will
                                            eventually  result  if  these  are  left  in  place.  Remove
                                            carefully and, if necessary, replace with smooth, solid
                                            plastic paper clips, white cotton tape ties or an acid-
                                            free folder or pocket. Rubber bands should be removed
                                            and discarded because they curl and tear the edges of
                                            paper and will eventually age and break.

                                     p.     Try  not  to  overstuff  or  under-fill  storage  boxes  –
                                            overstuffing  cramps  and  creases  items,  under  filling
                                            allows  sagging  and  bending.  Use  fillers  made  of  acid
                                            free materials.

                                     q.     Generally  books  should  be  supported  upright  on  the
                                            shelf  by  other  books  or  bookends.  Books  left  leaning
                                            on shelves can cause the book to become distorted and
                                            the binding may break. Large books such as elephant
                                            folios  and  broadsheets  should  be  stored  flat  on  the
                                            shelf otherwise the weight of the pages can damage the
                                            binding, but do not stack them too high or they will be
                                            difficult to remove.

                                     r.     Do  not  overcrowd  the  shelves.  Books  should  slide
                                            easily  onto  shelves  without  force.  Make  space  if  they
                                            do not. Shelves should be deep enough to fully support
                                            the volume and leave a space between the books and
                                            the back of the shelf to allow air circulation.

                                     s.     Make  sure  materials  in  compact  units  are  not
                                            protruding  or  likely  to  fall  on  the  ground,  because  it
                                            will be crushed.

                                     t.     A book should be removed from the shelf by grasping
                                            firmly  the  center  of  the  spine.  Never  remove  books
                                            from the shelves by pulling at the top of the spine, this
                                            is the most vulnerable part of the spine, and can tear
                                            or break easily.

                                     u.     Pamphlets  can  easily  be  lost  or  damaged  on  shelves
                                            because  they  are  so  small.  If  placed  straight  on  the
                                            shelf or in a half-filled upright pamphlet box, they can
                                            become  slouched,  squashed  and  crushed.  Individual
                                            pamphlets can be stored in see-through polypropylene
                                            folders  and  groups  of  pamphlets  and  serial  issues  in
                                            grey polypropylene serial boxes.

                                     v.     Single sheet materials are best stored flat in folder or
                                            boxes,  but  may  be  stored  upright  in  a  polypropylene
                                            pamphlet folder or with adequate support in a folder in
                                            an  archive  box  if  the  archive  box  has  been  filled  to
                                            prevent its contents sagging.

                                     w.     If  any  items  are  handled  frequently,  they  should  be
                                            placed  in  Mylar  pocket  or  copied,  to  protect  the
                                            original item.

                                     x.     Large  sheet  material  should  be  stored  flat  in  shallow
                                            plan cabinet drawers. Drawers should not be overfilled
                                            because  this  will  make  retrieval  difficult  and  sheets
                                            can easily be damaged as the drawers are opened and
                                            closed.  Do  not  fold  any  item;  it  will  eventually  break
                                            along the fold. If material is too large to fit in drawers,
                                            it  can  be  placed  in  a  folder  in  an  adequately  sized
                                            storage space or on storage rolls made for it.

                                     y.     Folded or rolled items should be opened with care and
                                            gently, but firmly, held open with paper weights; very
                                            stiff  and  tightly  rolled  items  may  need  to  be  relaxed
                                            before unrolling.

                                     z.     Large  plans,  maps,  or  any  large  paper  sheets  are
                                            preferably  handled  in  Mylar  pockets  and  are  usually
                                            easily carried by diagonally opposite corners.

                       Section 4. Disaster Preparedness

                                            Disasters  are  generally  unexpected  events  with
                                     destructive consequences to a collection. Therefore it is vital
                                     for  any  library  to  take  every  possible  precaution  to  prevent
                                     the  occurrence  of  an  unavoidable  disaster.  A  disaster
                                     planning is an essential element of preventive conservation.
                                     It  is  also  necessary  to  identify  any  external  and  internal
                                     threats  that  might  cause  problems  for  the  collection  and
                                     measures to meet those threats. Without an existing disaster
                                     preparedness plan or crisis management plan, the librarians
                                     will  be  unable  to  act  quickly  to  organise  salvage  efforts.  It
                                     should  be  mandatory  for  every  library  to  have  a  written
                                     disaster  preparedness  and  response  plan  containing
                                     description  of  emergency  procedures,  emergency  supplies
                                     list,  disaster  response  outline,  conservation  experts,  list  of
                                     staff  volunteers,  list  of  external  contacts  and  names,
                                     addresses, home and work telephone numbers of personnel
                                     with emergency responsibilities. Besides, libraries should be
                                     provided  with  fire  and  smoke  detection  system  and
                                     automatic  fire  extinguishing  system.  Use  of  match  stick  or
                                     open  flame  and  smoking  should  strictly  prohibit  inside  the
                                     library. Inflammable materials and chemicals should not be
                                     stored  inside  the  stacks.  The  telephone  number  of  the  fire
                                     office  should  be  visibly  and  clearly  exhibited.  Location  of
                                     emergency  gate  must  be  clearly  indicated.  The  electrical
                                     defects and faults should be set right in time.


                       Section 5. Responsibility

                                            Preservation and conservation of library materials are
                                     concern of all library staff and all users of the CvSU.

                                            The University Librarian is responsible for determining
                                     conservation priorities for all archival records, as well as the
                                     nature  and  extent  of  conservation  and  preservation
                                     treatments to be carried out.

                       Section 6. Selection of Library Materials for Preservation

                                            Materials are selected for preservation according to the

               Article 10. Weeding of Library Materials

                                     Weeding  is  the  process  wherein  books  and  other  library
                              materials that are no longer needed are taken out of the collection.
                              This is done to keep the collection updated and responsive to the
                              needs and interest  of the users.  This  may result in discarding of
                              materials. (Example: return to the supply office, donating to other
                              libraries, etc.)

                                     Evaluation of library collection is done in order to determine
                              if the materials the library has are still suitable to the needs of its
                              users.  Selection  and  acquisition  of  library  materials  plays  an
                              important  role  in  the  collection  development  as  weeding  of  non-
                              circulating  items  in  the  collection.  Weeding  is  necessary  to  make
                              space for current materials, to make the collection more attractive,
                              to facilitate ease of use of the collections by patrons and staff, and
                              to  reduce  damage  to  books  caused  by  overcrowding  and  space
                              limitations.

                       Section 1.  Weeding Criteria

                                            Library materials are weeded when:

                                            a.     the materials have not been used for more than
                                                   ten years;

                                            b.     the  condition  of  the  item  is  bad,  e.g.  missing
                                                   pages, worn-out, and text is unreadable;

                                            c.     the  Science  and  Technology  materials  that  are
                                                   copyrighted/published  more  than  three  to  five
                                                   years;

                                            d.     the materials are no longer in demand or do not
                                                   support  the  curriculum  or  current  academic
                                                   programs;

                                            e.     older edition of the book is no longer used; and

                                            f.     books become obsolete.

                       Section 2. Weeding Criteria for Specific Subject Fields

                                            a.     Philosophy (B-BD, BH, BJ)

                                                           Most  philosophy  books  do  not  become
                                                   outdated, although circulation is often low, titles
                                                   should  be  retained  unless  superseded  by  more
                                                   recent  editions.  However,  duplicate  copies  of
                                                   low-usage books are weeded so as historical and
                                                   explanatory  texts  when  superseded.  Books  on
                                                   systems of philosophy should be retained.

                                            b.     Psychology (BF)

                                                           A  5-year  weeding  process  shall  be
                                                   implemented  to  maintain  a  usable  and  up-to-
                                                   date collection. Biographies or primary works of
                                                   psychologists  and  encyclopedia  shall  be  judged
                                                   by their emphasis on primary works.

                                            c.     Religion (BL-BX)

                                                           Materials on this subject do not generally
                                                   become  outdated  but  titles  that  have  very  low
                                                   usage,  superseded  editions,  unused  duplicates,
                                                   older sectarian literature, sermons and books on
                                                   the  conduct  of  life  should  be  considered  for
                                                   weeding.

                                            d.     History (C, D, E, F)

                                                           History  collection  shall  be  periodically
                                                   reviewed  for  their  continuing  usefulness.  Older
                                                   books that reflect the expressions of another era,
                                                   regardless of the accuracy of predictions made in
                                                   them  about  the  future  and  earlier  editions  of
                                                   classic  or  standard  text  regardless  of  current
                                                   curriculum  needs,  are  retained.  Books  with
                                                   bibliography,  appendices,  maps,  illustrations  or
                                                   other  supplementary  features  that  are  still
                                                   useful should also be retained.

                                            e.     Geography (G-GR)

                                                           Books  in  this  subject  area  become
                                                   outdated  rapidly  and  shall  be  weeded  if  new
                                                   items are available.

                                                           Superseded       rulebooks      and     outdated
                                                   instructional materials should be weeded if new
                                                   items are available.

                                            g.     Social Science (H-HA)

                                                           Interdisciplinary needs shall be considered
                                                   when weeding since books in these subject areas
                                                   tend to be used in  supportive nature and  shall
                                                   not be analyzed according to circulation figures,
                                                   but  unless  they  have  historical  approach,  they
                                                   are of little use after five years. Books on finance
                                                   are outdated sooner than five years so they can
                                                   be weeded out first.

               Article 11. Collection Analysis and Evaluation

                       Section 1. Introduction

                                            Collection Analysis is the systematic evaluation of the
                                     quality  of  a  library  collection  to  determine  the  extent  to
                                     which it meets the library’s service goals and objectives and
                                     the information needs of its clientele.

                                            The purpose of collection analysis and evaluation is to
                                     determine the quality of the collection. It falls into two parts:
                                     first, one must evaluate the collection itself in terms of
                                     numbers, quality, currency, and the like. Second, the

                          Annex A: Codes for Levels of Collecting Intensity

                       1.     Research  Level.  Refers  to  the  major  published  source  materials
                              required  for  dissertation  and  independent  research,  including
                              materials  containing  research  reporting,  new  findings,  scientific
                              experimental results, and other information useful to researchers.
                              It is intended to include all important reference works and a wide
                              selection  of  specialized  monographs,  as  well  as  a  very  extensive
                              collection  of  journals  and  abstracting  services  in  the  field.  A
                              collection  at  this  level  supports  doctoral  and  other  original
                              research.

                       2.     Basic  Level.  Refers  to  the  resources  adequate  for  imparting  and
                              maintaining knowledge about the basic or primary topics of subject
                              area.  The  collection  includes  the  most  important  primary  and
                              secondary  literature,  a  selection  of  basic  representative  journals,
                              periodicals and subjects based indexes, the fundamental reference
                              and bibliographic tools pertaining to the subject.

                       3.     Minimal Level. Refers to the subject area in which few selections
                              are made beyond very basic works. A collection at this level should
                              be  frequently  and  systematically  reviewed  for  currency  of
                              information.  Superseded  editions  and  titles  containing  outdated
                              information are withdrawn.

                       4.     Study  Level.  Refers  to  the  collection  that  is  adequate  to  impart
                              and maintain knowledge about a subject in a systematic way but a
                              level of less than research intensity. The collection includes a wide
                              range of basic works in appropriate formats, a significant number
                              of classic retrospective materials, complete collection of the works
                              in appropriate formats, complete collections of the works of some
                              important writers, a selection of representative journals, access to
                              appropriate  machine  readable  data  files  and  the  reference  tools
                              and  fundamental  bibliographical  apparatus  pertaining  to  the
                              subject. At the study or instructional support level, a collection is
                              adequate  to  support  level,  a  collection  is  adequate  to  support
                              independent study and most learning needs of the clientele in the
                              undergraduate and some graduate instruction. If the collection is
                              significant information is retained.

                       5.     Initial  Study  Level.  The  emphasis  at  this  level  is  on  providing
                              resources that introduce and define a subject. A collection at this
                              level includes basic reference tools and explanatory works, such as
                              textbooks  and  historical  descriptions  of  the  selective  major
                              periodicals. The introductory level of a basic information collection

                              information  about  a  subject  of  students  enrolled  in  introductory
                              level courses.
